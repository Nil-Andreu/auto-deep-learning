# Creator

Inside this folder, we are going to have the files that manage converting the dataframes into a DataSet in PyTorch.
For this, we have the following:

- **base_creator**: responsible for the creation of dataset for each split type (train/valid/test)
- **data_creator**: responsible for joining the datasets created for each split type.
